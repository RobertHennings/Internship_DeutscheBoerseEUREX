# Internship_DeutscheBoerseEUREX
This repository contains background material that I used during my time as an intern at the EUREX Frankfurt AG in the Fixed Income Exchange Traded Derivatives Product Design Department. In consultation with my supervisor, these do not contain any confidential information or other clues or data that could indicate the final use. All Datasets are completely free available in the internet to the public and every private person, as well as all the academic papers.
